# Datasets

This folder contains the original datasets required for preprocessing. These files serve as the input for the preprocessing code provided in the repository and are necessary to run the analysis pipeline. Below is a description of each dataset:

- **listings.csv**: Contains detailed information about individual Airbnb listings, including attributes such as price, room type, and location.
- **calendar.csv.gz**: Includes daily availability and pricing data for Airbnb listings.
- **reviews.csv.gz**: Contains guest reviews for Airbnb listings, including comments and review dates. Due to space limitations, this file is not included in the repository. You can access it directly from the [Inside Airbnb website](https://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data/).
- **neighbourhood.csv**: Provides neighborhood information for mapping listings to specific areas.
