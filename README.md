## Project Overview
This project involves preprocessing raw datasets to clean, structure, and enhance them for analysis. The processed files can be used in BI tools like Qlik Sense to analyze Airbnb pricing, availability, reviews, and tourism trends, as well as compare Airbnb performance with Amsterdam’s hotel market.

## Contents of the Repository
- `datasets/`: Contains the raw datasets required for preprocessing. Refer to the `datasets/README.md` for details about the files.
- `BI-PreProccessingDatasetFINAL.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook with the full preprocessing pipeline.
- `BI-Amsterdam-Analysis.pdf`: A comprehensive document containing the preprocessing code, results, and insights for users unable to run the code.
- `screenshots/`: Folder containing screenshots of the Qlik dashboard analysis.
- `README.md`: Overview of the preprocessing steps and repository structure.

## Preprocessing
The preprocessing pipeline was implemented in Python using libraries such as `pandas`, `numpy`, and `NLTK`. It focuses on preparing the datasets for seamless integration into BI tools.

### Key Preprocessing Steps:
- **Data Cleaning**: Addressed missing values, removed duplicates, and standardized formats.
- **Feature Engineering**: Created new variables, such as `distance_to_center`, to enhance analytical value.
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Performed sentiment analysis on guest reviews using the VADER lexicon, with filtering for English comments.
- **Reshaping Tourism Data**: Cleaned and reshaped hotel tourism data from Statista into a format suitable for temporal analysis.
- **Outlier Detection and Removal**: Identified and handled outliers in pricing and other numeric fields.

The complete code for these steps is provided in the `BI-PreProccessingDatasetFINAL.ipynb` notebook.

## How to Use
1. Clone this repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/georgeTs19/BI-Amsterdam-Airbnb-Analysis.git
   ```
2. Download the reviews.csv.gz dataset from the Inside Airbnb website and place it in the datasets folder.
3. Open the BI-PreProccessingDatasetFINAL.ipynb notebook and run the code to preprocess the datasets.
4. Use the processed files in a BI application of your choice for further analysis.

- **Preference for Entire Homes**: There is a strong trend towards renting entire homes/apartments, with guests prioritizing privacy and space over private rooms.

### Limitations and Challenges  

While the Qlik dashboard analysis provides valuable insights, there are several limitations and challenges that should be considered:

1. **Data Completeness and Accuracy**:
   - The accuracy of the insights depends on the completeness and reliability of the data. Missing or outdated listings, as well as incomplete information on properties or host performance, could skew the results.
   - Certain listings that may no longer be active could still be included in the data, potentially leading to overestimations in metrics like total revenue or occupancy rates.

2. **Temporal Analysis Limitations**:
   - The data does not account for seasonal variations or changes over time beyond the immediate analysis period, limiting the ability to predict future trends in Airbnb listings or rentals accurately.
   - While the tourism growth rate shows a post-COVID recovery, it does not account for potential disruptions, such as new regulatory changes or unforeseen events (e.g., pandemics, economic downturns), that could affect both tourism and the short-term rental market.

3. **Absence of Regulatory Data**:
   - Amsterdam, like many cities, has introduced or may introduce regulations to control short-term rentals. The dashboard does not account for the impact of these regulations (e.g., rental caps or licensing requirements), which could significantly influence the Airbnb market in the future.

4. **Potential Bias in Reviews**:
   - The high percentage of positive reviews (98.62%) might indicate a bias, as guests with negative experiences are less likely to leave reviews or may be underrepresented. This can give a skewed representation of guest satisfaction and performance for hosts, particularly in areas with a large volume of listings.

5. **Market Segmentation**:
   - While the analysis captures general trends, it does not delve into the specifics of market segmentation, such as guest demographics (e.g., business vs. leisure travelers), which could provide further insights into pricing behavior and listing preferences.

6. **Limited Comparison with Other Platforms**:
   - The analysis focuses solely on Airbnb listings, without considering other short-term rental platforms (e.g., Booking.com, Vrbo) that might also contribute significantly to Amsterdam’s accommodation market. This limits the scope of the findings to Airbnb-specific trends and does not provide a complete view of the broader rental market.
